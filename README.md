### service-versioning.yml

This workflow is responsible for automatic service versioning. It is triggered on a commit to `develop`, either through a direct push to the branch, or through a merged PR. It increments a service version number, updates the service's `package.json` file and pushes a new commit, then updates the `Service version` field in the corresponding Jira ticket.
